  - Master Protobuf from scratch, understanding Google's language-neutral and platform-neutral serialization format for structured data.
-  Introduction to gRPC:
   - Explore the benefits of gRPC for microservices communication.
   - Delve into the different RPC types supported by gRPC, including Unary API, Client Streaming API, Server Streaming API, and Bidirectional Streaming API.
- Load Balancing:
  - Address challenges in load balancing with gRPC.
  - Explore various load balancing strategies and implement them with gRPC.
- Authentication:
  - Implement user session token passing for authentication in gRPC.
  - Explore client service token passing for authorization in gRPC.
- Error Handling:
  - Master error handling techniques in gRPC.
  - Utilize Protobuf OneOf for error handling and explore error handling through exceptions.
- Spring Boot Integration:
  - Integrate gRPC seamlessly with Spring Boot microservices.
  - Develop multiple services and ensure smooth integration between them
- Best Practices and Real-World Considerations:
  - Discuss best practices for gRPC-based microservices development.
  - Address real-world challenges and considerations in gRPC implementations.
